Hi, I am Tarundeep Singh
I am a web Developer. I enjoy what I do and create elegantly simple things using code.
I'm a newbie, but I've already finished a few tasks, such as creating calculators in Java and E-commerce websites for eyewear and TVs in Asp.net and C#, respectively. 
Languages like Java, C#, C++, PHP, and JavaScript are ones I am familiar with. I'm not an expert in that, but I can manage it and create something wonderful and responsive from it. 
I have a peaceful sense of assurance, am innately interested, and am constantly trying to get better at design by solving one design problem at a time.
